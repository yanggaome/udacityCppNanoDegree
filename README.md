# Udacity C++ Nano Degree Program
https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213

## Learn C++ by Coding Five Projects
Get hands-on experience by coding five real-world projects. Learn to build a route planner using OpenStreetMap data, write a process monitor for your computer, and implement your own smart pointers. Finally, showcase all your newfound skills by building a multithreaded traffic simulator and coding your own C++ application.

4 months to complete

PREREQUISITE KNOWLEDGE
To optimize your chances of success in the C++ Nanodegree program, we recommend intermediate knowledge of any programming language.

## C++ Foundations
Learn how to develop, compile, and execute C++ programs as well as syntax, functions, containers, and how to link together multiple files.

**C++ Project: [Route Planner with Astar Search](https://github.com/yanggaome/udacityCppNanoDegree/tree/main/CppND-Route-Planning-Project)**

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Learn to build classes, interfaces, and generic templates to create an object-oriented C++ program. Learn how modern C++ includes many tools for writing clean, reusable code.

C++ Project: process monitor

## Memory Management
Learn to control static and dynamic memory in C++ using the Resource Acquisition Is Initialization pattern, pointers, references, and move semantics.

Project: memory management chatbot

## Concurrency
C++ supports running multiple execution paths in parallel. Learn how to launch process and threads in order to execute logic in parallel. Then advance to thread synchronization and communication, to experience the full power of concurrent programming.

Project: concurrent traffic simulation

## Capstone Project
In your Capstone Project, you will put all of your new C++ skills to use! Utilize the core concepts from this Nanodegree program - object-oriented programming, memory management, and concurrency - to build your own application using C++.
